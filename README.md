# print(fiction)

A predictive modeling project by Tobias Reaper.

I scraped the metadata for ~20,000 books from GoodReads, and used that to train/validate a supervised machine learning model. The model was then deployed as a dashboard using Plotly Dash.

The live dashboard can be found [here](https://print-fiction.herokuapp.com/).
